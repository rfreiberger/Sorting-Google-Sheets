# Sorting-Google-Sheets
A simple script to pull down Google Sheets and then sort the data.

## What is this? 

At work we're sorting some data through Google Sheets and I haven't worked on much with the Google API. Functions this script is planned to complete.
* Through the Google Sheets API, copy the defined Worksheet as a list
* Print the list with the Worksheet column titles
* Take a single argument to define with Worksheet to contact
Bonus Goals
* Given a repo, clone the repo locally on the workstation
* From the path in column A, search the repo for matching files and move them to /tmp
* Create a compressed tar file from the matching files
